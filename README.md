# Financial-Risk-Analysis-with-Python-Goldman-Sachs-Financial-Analysis-Dataset-

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to perform an end-to-end financial transaction and risk analysis using Python. The project focuses on transforming raw banking transaction data into actionable insights by:

Cleaning and standardizing financial data

Analyzing transactional behavior over time

Profiling customers based on activity, balance, and inflow patterns

Identifying dormant accounts and high-risk financial behavior

Detecting anomalies and potential financial risks

Supporting insights with statistical hypothesis testing and visual analytics

This project demonstrates how data analytics can support risk monitoring, customer segmentation, and decision-making in a financial institution.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. Data Quality & Structure

The dataset contains 800 transactions across 188 customers with no missing values.

Financial fields were successfully standardized, dates were validated, and categorical variables were normalized.

No duplicate records were found, ensuring high data integrity.

### 2. Transactional Behavior Analysis
   
Transactions are well distributed across Credit, Savings, Loan, and Current accounts.

Monthly analysis revealed fluctuating credit and debit volumes, with debits (withdrawals, payments, transfers) dominating several periods.

Net transaction flow varies significantly across accounts, indicating uneven liquidity behavior.
